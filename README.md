Calculator

This project includes a Node.js server script and a web page that connects to it. The front-end page presents a form the visitor can use to submit a color name, sending the submitted value to the back-end API running on the server. The server returns info to the page that allows it to update the display with the chosen color. ðŸŽ¨

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript. This project uses the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework and explores basic templating with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

This app is designed to fit all screen sizes (phone, tablet, computer, etc.) When the screen is in portrait mode it is a standard calculator. When in landscape, it becomes a 3D graphing calcualtor. URL: https://calculator-df6f0.web.app/
